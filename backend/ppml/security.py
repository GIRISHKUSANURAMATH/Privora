"""ASGI-level request guards that must run before any body parsing.

``BodySizeLimitMiddleware`` counts bytes as they stream in and aborts with 413 as soon as the
limit is exceeded. A ``Content-Length`` check alone is not enough: a client can use chunked
transfer encoding (no ``Content-Length``), and Starlette's multipart parser would otherwise spool
the entire body to a temporary file before the endpoint's own size check runs.
